Welcome to D&D Fighter!

The idea is very simple. You want to create characters, make them fight, and level them up. Sounds fun, right?

At first I tried many unnecessary ideas which might yet make it into a second release. For example, a second database connection for items.

I settled on the basic CRUD. One can create characters and assign them certain stats. One can delete or update these characters as desired. They can be improved via leveling up.

During a fight, there are three options. Flee will return to the main menu. Defend will roll to remove damage from your opponent's next strike. And of course, you may attack.
There are three kinds of weapons. Ranged, which receives points from Agility. Sorcery, which receives from Wisdom. Melee, which receives from Strength.

Charisma is a useless stat as of v1.0. Until we update, you might as well set it to 0. Mana is also useless as present.
